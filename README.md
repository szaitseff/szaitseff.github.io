Hey, I am Sergei. I have master degrees in Physics and Economics, and continue professional development in Computer Science with particular interest in Machine Learning. Here is a complete log of my progress in Computer Science guided by the <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"> <img alt="Open Source Society University - Computer Science" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg"> </a> curriculum. It also includes my extra curriculum activities in Computer Science and Data Science. My coursework code is placed in separate repositories, where applicable. 

The <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"> <img alt="Open Source Society University - Computer Science" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg"> </a> describes its Curriculum as:
> ... a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
> It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines.
> It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
> The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.

The <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"> <img alt="Open Source Society University - Computer Science" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg"> </a> curriculum is designed as follows (I don't follow the exact sequence of courses and opt-put of e.g. Math courses):
