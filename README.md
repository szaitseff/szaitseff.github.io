Hey, I am Sergei. I have master degrees in Physics and Economics, and continue professional development in Computer Science with particular interest in Data Science and Machine Learning. Here is a complete log of my progress in Computer Science guided by the [OSSU Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/README.md). It also includes my extra curriculum activities in Computer Science and Data Science. My coursework code is placed in separate repositories, where applicable. 

The OSSU describes its Curriculum as:
> ... a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
> It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines.
> It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
> The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.

The [OSSU Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/README.md) is designed into the following sections (with a quick ref link to each of them):

<a href="#intro-to-cs"> *Intro CS* </a> - for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them <br>
<a href="#core-cs"> *Core CS* </a> - corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take <br>
<a href="#advanced-cs"> *Advanced CS* </a> - corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests <br>
<a href="#projects"> *Projects* </a> - to validate, consolidate, and display the knowledge

With my progress in the CS Curriculum, I've got a particular interest in Data Science and Machine Learning. The OSSU also has a [Data Science Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/data-science/blob/master/README.md), which is heavily biased towards the math basics. With a solid math background, I prefer to complement the original CS Curriculum with the best available courses in Data Science. Therefore, I've added the whole new section on Data Science and Machine Learning, which comes the first below.

**Note:** I stick to Python and its ecosystem so far in my current projects. In CS50, I also learned basics of C and Web stack (HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery+Python/Flask/Jinja+SQLite). Courses in this section teach programming concepts with such languages as Lisp-family, Java, ML, Ruby, Haskell, Prolog. I prioritize them as 'nice to have', but after I've covered other topics of the Curriculum.
